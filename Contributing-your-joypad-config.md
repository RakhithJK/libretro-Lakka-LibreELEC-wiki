Once your joypad have been configured manually, you can generate an autoconfig file. Sending this file to the development team ensure that your joypad will work out of the box on the next releases.

## Generate the joypad autoconfig file

In the **Input Settings**, after the manuall bind, use the **Save autoconfig** entry.

You should see a confirmation message.

A file should be created in the **joypads/udev/** folder.

## Send us the file

There are many ways to send us that file.

 * By [mail](http://www.lakka.tv/contact)
 * Using our [github issue tracker](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka/issues)
 * Pull Request on [RetroArch Joypad Autoconfig repository](https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig), the file goes in the udev folder.

We prefer pull requests, but if you don't know what it is, just use the issue tracker. And if you don't want to register on github just for that, use the mail.
