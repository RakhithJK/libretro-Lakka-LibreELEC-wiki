RetroAchievements is a third party service that provides achievements unlocking for classic games, just like any other gaming platforms like Steam or XBox. All your unlocks will be saved to your Retro Achievements account.

## Account creation

First, you will need to head on over to [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org/) and create an account. When you’re at the site, click **Create a new Account** in the top left corner of the page. Proceed with filling in all the requested information. Once that is all done, be sure to write down your **username** and **password**. This is important, as you will need these credentials later on in this tutorial.

## Setup your credentials in Lakka

1. Make sure your Lakka box is connected to internet.
2. Go to **Settings → Retro Achievements**.
3. Switch both settings from **OFF** to **ON**
4. Go back to **Settings**,  and scroll down and enter **User**
5. When in **User**, proceed to **Accounts → Retro Achievements**
6. Enter your **Username** and **Password** using the UP and DOWN and OK keys. Hit START when you're done.

## Test the feature

Load a well known classic game. When you unlock an achievement, you will see a yellow message at the bottom of the screen.
