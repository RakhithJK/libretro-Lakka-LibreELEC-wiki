Updating Lakka can break your system if you have customized it a lot. Before you choose to update, it is wise to backup important things like your savefiles.

The following upgrade procedures will upgrade the kernel and the system. Sometimes, the bootloader configuration will be updated too. But it will not update the configuration file of retroarch. This can lead to problems like wrong paths.

To avoid these issues, you should purge your retroarch.cfg after the upgrade.

## Upgrade procedures
